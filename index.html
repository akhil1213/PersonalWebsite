				<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I am currently seeking a Software Engineer Internship. I have been working on several projects in various fields of Computer Science but have been focusing on Data Science and Web/Mobile development. I have dived into all of these fields mainly using technologies such as React, React-Native, Python-Django and libraries such as pandas, seaborn, sklearn respectively. I am proficient in Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems. For any further questions, please feel free to <a href = "">contact</a> me.</p>
					<p>I am currently a computer science major at Queens College. In the last two years of my college experience, I have remained focused in understanding programming languages and tools. I consider myself as an ambitious student looking to gain experience in the field of computer science.
						While pursing my education, I have been known for my ability to work well with my peers. I enjoy challenging myself and demonstrate strength in problem solving skills. In order to accomplish my goals, I stay organized and focused with tasks on hand.
						Often, I find myself exploring multiple different technologies and trying to understand how they were implemented and most importantly fabricated.
