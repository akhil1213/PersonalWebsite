				<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I am currently seeking a Software Engineer Internship. I have been working on several projects in various fields of Computer Science but have been focusing on Data Science and Web/Mobile development. I have dived into all of these fields mainly using technologies such as React, React-Native, Python-Django and libraries such as pandas, seaborn, sklearn respectively. I am proficient in Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems. For any further questions, please feel free to <a href = "">contact</a> me.</p>
					<p>I am currently a computer science major at Queens College. In the last two years of my college experience, I have remained focused in understanding programming languages and tools. I consider myself as an ambitious student looking to gain experience in the field of computer science.
						While pursing my education, I have been known for my ability to work well with my peers. I enjoy challenging myself and demonstrate strength in problem solving skills. In order to accomplish my goals, I stay organized and focused with tasks on hand.
						Often, I find myself exploring multiple different technologies and trying to understand how they were implemented and most importantly fabricated.

								<p>Technologies I used were Python-Django, AWS lamdba/s3, and textract. A forum pdf file of each client's information is dragged into the file upload input using JavaScript which is then converted into a png using the pdf2png api. Then this image is sent to AWS s3 using boto3,and then textract sends back key/value pairs of the forum. I then created an algorithm to extract the proper data from key/value pairs given to us from textract. On top of that, I verified customers credit score using the credco api by sending the social security number of each client to their endpoint. I also did a background check using Clear Logic api's and retrived a person/business report.  All the extracted data was posted to the Salesforce CRM using SalesforceApi. I am currently working on converting the frontend from plain vanilla Html/Css to React.</p>

  							<p>Working on cloning the Instagram app using React-Native, Redux, and Sqlite. Figuring out the database schema of Instagram as I progress the cloned application. Adding a comment has it's own view and the input field is all the way on the bottom. After clicking on the input, the keyboard pops up and covers the input field so I took care of that and moved the input right above the keyboard using animations. As of now, I'm figuring out the db schema so when a user loads up his feed page, the photos and comments he's liked before show up as liked and vica versa.</p>

As well as connecting the frontend to the backend using express routes to make get,post,put, and delete requests to the mongoDB running inside the backend server.
